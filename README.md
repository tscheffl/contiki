Contiki OS - Examples
============================



This is a fork of the Contiki open source operating system for microcontrollers.

The fork is used to host and document several extensions and applications that are currently developed at the  [IPv6-Lab at the Beuth Hochschule f√ºr Technik Berlin, Germany](https://wiki.ipv6lab.beuth-hochschule.de).

This branch is brought forward to the HEAD of the main Contiki development tree at irregular intervals. If this happen while you have checked out a local version, use the following command to synchronize:

    git reset --hard origin/tscheffl-3-0.0
